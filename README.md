# Multi-Ouput-Regressor


This project predicts the lower part of a face image (Output being of 2048 pixels) based on the upper part using Random Forest and Extra Trees models with MultiOutputRegressor. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Note: Hyperparameters should be tuned accordingly using optimization techniques (not implemented here to keep it simple).
