# Multi-Ouput-Regressor



Hereâ€™s a more concise version of the README:

Face Completion Model
This project predicts the lower part of a face image based on the upper part using Random Forest and Extra Trees models with MultiOutputRegressor. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Note : Tune HyperParameters Accordingly using Optimization Techniques (Didnt done due to make it simple )
